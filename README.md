These are my mini-projects: tutorials and small-scale exercises intended for learning specific tools and algorithms. Within each repo, I explain the learning objectives for each project.

These projects should require a smaller time commitment and research phase than my typical projects, and are intended for gaining familiarity with specific techniques. I may evolve some into larger projects if they're interesting enough.

## Mini-projects

* Box Office Revenue Prediction: a regression project using data from The Movie Database (practicing ML workflow and data processing using custom transformers)
* SF Gate Home Price Prediction: also a regression project, for practicing workflow and creating functions to make model training + evaluation quicker
* First Flask App: tutorial on building an API in Python using flask... for future use in building my own fullstack ML app
