These are my mini-projects: tutorials and small-scale exercises intended for learning specific tools and algorithms. Within each repo, I explain the learning objectives for each project.

These projects should require a smaller time commitment and research phase than my typical projects, and are intended for gaining familiarity with specific techniques. I may evolve some into larger projects if they're interesting enough.

## Mini-projects

* **Box Office Revenue Prediction:** a regression project using data from The Movie Database 	
	* ML workflow
	* Processing data with custom transformers + Scikit-Learn Pipelines
	* Using random forests for feature selection
* **SF Gate Home Price Prediction:** regression project based on data scraped from SF Gate
	* Practice ML workflow 
	* Analysis of outliers (basic critical thinking)
	* Create functions to make model training + evaluation quicker
* **First Flask App:** tutorial on building an API (that records names) in Python using flask
	* For future use in building my own fullstack ML app
