This project is me workthing through a tutorial on [Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-cleaning-and-feature-engineering-in-python-b4d448366022).

I think it can be really helpful to understand how other people approach the modeling workflow. Hopefully I'll gain some insights about how I want to structure my future data processing pipelines.
