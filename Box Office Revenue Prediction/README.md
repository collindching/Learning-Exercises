This mini project is an exercise to reinforce what I've learned in chapter 2 of Hands-On ML. I want to focus on building data transformation and prediction pipelines in Python. I'll be building a regression model for box office revenues using movie data from The Movie Database. 

### Learning goals

* Practice the ML workflow in Python
* Transfer R data preparation knowledge to Python
* Learn to build data transformation pipelines with sklearn's Pipeline

### Work log

* 40 min + 30 min (started - July 22)
* 30 min (July 23)
