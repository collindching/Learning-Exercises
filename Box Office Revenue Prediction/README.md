This is an exercise to reinforce what I've learned in chapter 2 of Hands-On ML. I'll be building a regression model for box office revenues using movie data from The Movie Database. 

I wanted to practice processing data using custom transformers and Scikit-Learn Pipelines. This took way longer than I anticipated, and was very coding heavy. 

This project ended up taking me much longer than I intended. I've finished pretty much everything I wanted to practice. If I were to return to this to improve model performance, I'd focus on feature engineering, feature selection, and introducing external data.

## Learning goals

* [x] Practice Python ML workflow
* [x] Learn to build data processing pipelines in Sklearn

## Things learned

* Outlier analysis
* Data cleaning (for exploration) vs. data preprocessing (for modeling)
* Building transformers and Pipelines with Scikit-Learn
* Feature selection using Random Forests
* Apply with anonymous function
* List comprehensions
* Conditional expressions

## Things to improve on in future projects

* Allocate more time upfront to exploration
* Analyze outliers with scatterplots, decide to remove or not
* Separate the data cleaning step (exploration) from data processing step (modeling)
* Use `sklearn.feature_selection` module to speed up feature selection process
