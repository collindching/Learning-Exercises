This is an exercise to reinforce what I've learned in chapter 2 of Hands-On ML. I'll be building a regression model for box office revenues using movie data from The Movie Database. 

## Learning goals

* Practice Python ML workflow
* Learn to build data transformation pipelines in sklearn

## To do

* They're actually lists of JSON
* Extract one example

* Toggle pipeline with GridSearchCV for primary language
* Don't stress!

## Work log

* 40 min (preliminary research)
* 30 min (July 22)
* 3 * 30 min (July 23)
* 15 min (July 24)
* 4 * 30 min (July 25)
