This is an exercise to reinforce what I've learned in chapter 2 of Hands-On ML. I'll be building a regression model for box office revenues using movie data from The Movie Database. 

One of the key things I wanted to practice in this project was how to process data using custom transformers and Scikit-Learn Pipelines. This actually ended up taking a pretty long time to test code. The data preprocessing step actually felt more like programming and coding than machine learning, and I spent a lot of time debugging. 

This project ended up taking me much longer than I intended (for a practice exercise). Since I've done a majority of the processing, I'm going to shelve it for now. I'd love to come back in the future and try to finish this up though. 

## Learning goals

* Practice Python ML workflow
* Learn to build data processing pipelines in Sklearn

## Work log

* 1x40 min (preliminary research)
* 1x30 min (July 22)
* 3x30 min (July 23)
* 1x15 min (July 24)
* 4x30 min (July 25)
* 1x30 min, 2x40 min, 1x20 min (July 26)
* 1x30 min (July 27)
* 2x60 min (July 30)
* 4x60 min (Aug 6)
* 2x60 min, 1x30 min (Aug 7)
* 4x60 min (Aug 8)
* 1x60 min, 2x30 min (Aug 9)
* 1x60 min (Aug 14)

## Things learned

* Apply with anonymous function
* List comprehensions
* Conditional expressions
* Building transformers and Pipelines with Scikit-Learn

## Things to do better for next time

* I spent a lot of time processing the data but not exploring it; allocate more time to exploration
* Separate the data preparation step from the data processing step -- this will eliminate confusion as you write more code
* Be more creative with Pipeline usage
