This is an exercise to reinforce what I've learned in chapter 2 of Hands-On ML. I'll be building a regression model for box office revenues using movie data from The Movie Database. 

One of the key things I wanted to practice in this project was how to create pipelines using Scikit-Learn. This actually ended up taking a pretty long time to test code. The data preprocessing step actually felt more like programming and coding than machine learning, and I spent a large portion of my time debugging.

## Learning goals

* Practice Python ML workflow
* Learn to build data transformation pipelines in sklearn

## Work log

* 1x40 min (preliminary research)
* 1x30 min (July 22)
* 3x30 min (July 23)
* 1x15 min (July 24)
* 4x30 min (July 25)
* 1x30 min, 2x40 min, 1x20 min (July 26)
* 1x30 min (July 27)
* 2x60 min (July 30)
* 4x60 min (Aug 6)
* 2x60 min, 1x30 min (Aug 7)
* 4x60 min (Aug 8)

## Things learned

* Apply with anonymous function
* List comprehensions
