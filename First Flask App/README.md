Building APIs is a necessary step in building machine learning web applications. In this project, I created my first API in Python with Flask and Flask REST-Plus. This is an API that  stores and presents names.

Flask is a framework for turning Python functions into APIs. Flask REST-Plus helps to quickly build REST APIS.

[Here's](https://towardsdatascience.com/working-with-apis-using-flask-flask-restplus-and-swagger-ui-7cf447deda7f) the tutorial I used to make this.

## Take this API for a test run

1. If you don't have flask on your computer yet, run these commands
```
pip install flask
pip install flask-restplus
```
2. Download **`App.py`**
3. Navigate to **`App.py`**'s directory in terminal
4. Run `FLASK_APP=basic.py flask run`
5. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser
